   - Status changed to 'sent'
   - No longer editable

3. **Supplier Confirmation** (Confirmed status)
   - Supplier confirms receipt and acceptance
   - Optional: Update delivery date and reference
   - Status changed to 'confirmed'

4. **Receive Items** (Partially Received/Received status)
   - Items received at warehouse
   - Inventory automatically updated
   - Status based on completion (partial/full)

5. **Complete Order** (Completed status)
   - All items received and processed

   - Archived for reporting

### Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  await apiClient.sendPurchaseOrder(orderId, emailData);
  toast.success('Purchase order sent successfully');
} catch (error) {
  toast.error(error.message || 'Failed to send purchase order');
}
```
